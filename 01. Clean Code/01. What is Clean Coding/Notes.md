The most important reason to learn low-level design (LLD) is to write clean code. Clean code refers to code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows coding standards, is well-organized, and has good documentation. Writing clean code is crucial because it brings several benefits:

**1. Readability:** Clean code is easy to read and comprehend. Other developers can understand the code quickly, reducing the learning curve and improving collaboration within a team.

**2. Maintainability:** Clean code is easier to maintain and modify. When code is clean and well-structured, making changes, fixing bugs, and adding new features becomes simpler and less error-prone.

**3. Scalability:** Clean code is scalable. It allows for easier integration with other modules and systems, making it more adaptable to future changes and enhancements.

**4. Debugging:** Clean code makes debugging more efficient. When the code is well-organized and follows best practices, it becomes easier to locate and fix issues, reducing debugging time.

**5. Reusability:** Clean code is reusable. By following modular and decoupled design principles, clean code can be easily extracted and reused in different parts of the system, improving development efficiency.

**6. Team Collaboration:** Clean code promotes better collaboration within a development team. When everyone follows consistent coding practices and standards, it becomes easier for team members to understand and work on each other's code.

Overall, writing clean code benefits both developers and the organization. It leads to improved productivity, code quality, and maintainability. As the size of the company or team increases, the importance of clean code becomes even more significant, as it enables effective collaboration and reduces the chances of code becoming a hindrance to development efforts.

The provided code snippets demonstrate an example of converting dirty code into clean code by following low-level design (LLD) and clean coding standards. Let's analyze the changes made to the code in terms of LLD and clean coding principles:

**Dirty Code:**
```java
public class Dirty {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = new int[]{5, 3, 7, 9, 12, 4, 7};
        int c1 = 0, c2 = 0; // Bad Naming 
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(i < nums.length-1) {
                if((nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 3 == 0) // Many levels of indentation
                    c1++;
                if((nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 5 == 0) // No modularity, violates DRY 
                    c2++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(c1 + " " +c2);
    }
}
```

**Clean Code:**
```java
public class Clean {
    
    public static boolean isSumDivisibleByVal(int sum, int val) {
        return sum % val == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = new int[]{5, 3, 7, 9, 12, 4, 7};
        int[] divisors = new int[]{3, 5};
        int[] countOfDivisibleAdjPairs = new int[]{0, 0};

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            int adjPairSum = nums[i] + nums[i+1];
            for (int j = 0; j < divisors.length; j++) {
                if (isSumDivisibleByVal(adjPairSum, divisors[j])) 
                    countOfDivisibleAdjPairs[j]++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(countOfDivisibleAdjPairs[0] + " " + countOfDivisibleAdjPairs[1]);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. Naming Conventions: In the dirty code, variables `c1` and `c2` have unclear and uninformative names. In the clean code, the variables are replaced with `countOfDivisibleAdjPairs`, which accurately reflects their purpose.

2. Indentation and Modularity: The dirty code has multiple levels of indentation, making it harder to read and understand. In the clean code, the inner loop is extracted into a separate method `isSumDivisibleByVal`, which improves modularity and reduces the levels of indentation.

3. Violation of DRY Principle: The dirty code calculates the sum of adjacent pairs twice, violating the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. In the clean code, the sum is calculated once and stored in the `adjPairSum` variable, which is reused for divisibility checks.

4. Clearer Logic: The clean code uses a clearer logic by introducing arrays `divisors` and `countOfDivisibleAdjPairs`. This allows for a more scalable solution, as additional divisors can be easily added without modifying the core logic.

5. Improved Readability: By following LLD and clean coding standards, the clean code becomes more readable and maintainable. Variable names, indentation, and modularity are improved, leading to better code comprehension.

The clean code adheres to clean coding principles, such as meaningful naming, modularity, code reuse, and readability. These practices contribute to the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.
