**Introduction:**
In software development, writing clean code is essential for creating maintainable, readable, and efficient programs. Clean code is easier to understand, debug, and modify, leading to reduced bugs and improved collaboration among team members. In low-level design, clean code is particularly important as it focuses on the implementation details and individual functions. Clean functions adhere to principles and best practices that make them easier to comprehend, test, and modify.

**Importance of Clean Functions in Low-Level Design:**
Clean functions play a crucial role in low-level design by promoting readability, maintainability, and reusability. Here are some key reasons why clean functions are important:

1. **Readability:** Clean functions have clear names, minimal complexity, and limited side effects. They are organized logically and follow a consistent coding style. These characteristics enhance readability, allowing developers to understand the code's purpose and behavior more easily.

2. **Modularity:** Clean functions adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), focusing on a single task or responsibility. This modularity makes it simpler to reason about each function independently, leading to better code organization and easier maintenance.

3. **Maintainability:** Clean functions are easier to maintain because they are concise, well-named, and have a limited scope. Changes or bug fixes can be implemented more efficiently within clean functions, reducing the risk of introducing unintended side effects.

4. **Testability:** Clean functions are designed to be testable in isolation. They have well-defined inputs and outputs, making it easier to write unit tests. By reducing dependencies and side effects, clean functions facilitate comprehensive test coverage, enabling developers to catch bugs early and ensure the code's correctness.

5. **Reusability:** Clean functions with well-defined responsibilities and minimal dependencies are highly reusable. They can be easily invoked from different parts of the codebase or in other projects, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.

6. **Collaboration:** Clean functions enhance collaboration among team members. Code that follows clean coding principles is easier to understand and work with, fostering effective communication and collaboration within the development team.

# Here's an example of an unclean function that violates clean coding principles, followed by a clean version of the same functionality.

**Unclean Function:**
```java
public static void processArray(int[] numbers) {
    int sum = 0;
    int product = 1;
    int gcd = numbers[0];
    int parityCheck = numbers[0] % 2;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        sum += numbers[i];
        product *= numbers[i];
        
        gcd = findGCD(gcd, numbers[i]);
        
        if (numbers[i] % 2 != parityCheck) {
            parityCheck = -1;
        }
    }
    
    System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    System.out.println("Product: " + product);
    System.out.println("GCD: " + gcd);
    
    if (parityCheck == 0) {
        System.out.println("All numbers are even.");
    } else if (parityCheck == 1) {
        System.out.println("All numbers are odd.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Numbers have mixed parity.");
    }
}

private static int findGCD(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}
```

Explanation of the Unclean Function:
- The unclean function, `processArray`, violates clean coding principles in multiple ways.
- It performs multiple operations within a single function, including transforming an array, finding the sum, product, and GCD, checking parity, and printing the results.
- The function is too long and lacks clear separation of responsibilities.
- It has multiple variables that store different calculations and states.
- The function mixes the calculation logic with the printing of results, leading to poor modularity and readability.

**Clean Function:**
```java
public static void processArray(int[] numbers) {
    int sum = calculateSum(numbers);
    int product = calculateProduct(numbers);
    int gcd = findGCD(numbers);
    String parityStatus = checkParity(numbers);
    
    printResults(sum, product, gcd, parityStatus);
}

private static int calculateSum(int[] numbers) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : numbers) {
        sum += num;
    }
    return sum;
}

private static int calculateProduct(int[] numbers) {
    int product = 1;
    for (int num : numbers) {
        product *= num;
    }
    return product;
}

private static int findGCD(int[] numbers) {
    int gcd = numbers[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        gcd = findGCD(gcd, numbers[i]);
    }
    return gcd;
}

private static int findGCD(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

private static String checkParity(int[] numbers) {
    int parityCheck = numbers[0] % 2;
    for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (numbers[i] % 2 != parityCheck) {
            return "Mixed Parity";
        }
    }
    return parityCheck == 0 ? "All Even" : "All Odd";
}

private static void printResults(int sum, int product, int gcd, String parityStatus) {
    System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    System.out.println("Product: " + product);
    System.out.println("GCD: " + gcd);
    System.out.println("Parity: " + parityStatus);
}
```

Explanation of the Clean Function:
- The clean function, `processArray`, focuses on a single responsibility: processing an array and printing the results.
- The function is divided into smaller, well-defined methods that perform specific tasks such as calculating the sum, product, GCD, checking parity, and printing the results.
- Each method has a clear purpose and focuses on doing its task accurately.
- By separating the calculations and printing of results into different methods, the clean function achieves better modularity and readability.
- The function uses meaningful variable names and follows a consistent coding style, improving code understanding.
- The clean function follows the "do one thing and do it well" principle, resulting in a more maintainable and readable codebase.

By refactoring the unclean function into a clean version, we have improved code readability, maintainability, and adherence to clean coding principles. Each function has a single responsibility, leading to more modular and reusable code. The clean function is easier to understand, test, and modify, fostering better code quality and collaboration within the development team.

A function does exactly one thing if either of these hold:

**1) One can't meaningfully extract any other function from it:**
When a function cannot be further divided into smaller, meaningful sub-tasks, it indicates that the function already has a well-defined purpose. It performs a specific operation or task that cannot be logically separated. In such cases, extracting additional functions would not make sense as the function already encapsulates a single task effectively.

**2) All lines are just 1st level of abstraction below the function's level:**
When all lines of code within a function are at the same level of abstraction, it implies that the function maintains a consistent focus and performs a cohesive operation. There are no nested conditions, loops, or complex operations that obscure the primary purpose of the function. Each line of code contributes directly to the higher-level task without introducing unrelated functionality or lower-level details.

In both cases, the goal is to provide a function that is self-contained and easily understandable at a higher level. The reader should not be burdened with micro-level details such as specific implementation algorithms (e.g., GCD calculation) or low-level operations (e.g., bit-level operators). Instead, they should be able to comprehend the function's purpose and its role in the broader context of the codebase.

Here's an implementation of the `PrintAdjacentCoPrimeWithSameParity()` function and its associated functions:

```java
public class CoPrimePairs {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = { 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 };
        printAdjacentCoPrimeWithSameParity(numbers);
    }

    private static void printAdjacentCoPrimeWithSameParity(int[] numbers) {
        int[] absNumbers = changeElementToAbsValue(numbers);
        boolean[] coPrimeFlags = areCoPrime(absNumbers);
        boolean[] parityFlags = isParitySame(numbers);

        printPairs(numbers, coPrimeFlags, parityFlags);
    }

    private static int[] changeElementToAbsValue(int[] numbers) {
        int[] absNumbers = new int[numbers.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            absNumbers[i] = Math.abs(numbers[i]);
        }
        return absNumbers;
    }

    private static boolean[] areCoPrime(int[] numbers) {
        boolean[] coPrimeFlags = new boolean[numbers.length - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) {
            int num1 = numbers[i];
            int num2 = numbers[i + 1];
            int gcd = getGCD(num1, num2);
            coPrimeFlags[i] = (gcd == 1);
        }
        return coPrimeFlags;
    }

    private static int getGCD(int num1, int num2) {
        while (num2 != 0) {
            int temp = num2;
            num2 = num1 % num2;
            num1 = temp;
        }
        return num1;
    }

    private static boolean[] isParitySame(int[] numbers) {
        boolean[] parityFlags = new boolean[numbers.length - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) {
            int num1 = numbers[i];
            int num2 = numbers[i + 1];
            parityFlags[i] = (num1 % 2 == num2 % 2);
        }
        return parityFlags;
    }

    private static void printPairs(int[] numbers, boolean[] coPrimeFlags, boolean[] parityFlags) {
        for (int i = 0; i < coPrimeFlags.length; i++) {
            if (coPrimeFlags[i] && parityFlags[i]) {
                System.out.println(numbers[i] + ", " + numbers[i + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `PrintAdjacentCoPrimeWithSameParity()` function orchestrates the sequence of operations. It calls the `changeElementToAbsValue()`, `areCoPrime()`, `isParitySame()`, and `printPairs()` functions in the appropriate order to achieve the desired functionality.

The `changeElementToAbsValue()` function takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with the absolute values of each element, utilizing the `Math.abs()` function.

The `areCoPrime()` function determines if each pair of adjacent numbers is co-prime by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the `getGCD()` function.

The `isParitySame()` function checks if each pair of adjacent numbers has the same parity (both even or both odd).

Finally, the `printPairs()` function prints the pairs of adjacent numbers that are both co-prime and have the same parity.

By breaking down the functionality into separate functions, each with a single responsibility, the code becomes more modular, readable, and maintainable. The implementation follows the principle of clean functions, where each function performs a specific task without exposing unnecessary implementation details.

In the example of `PrintAdjacentCoPrimeWithSameParity()`, by looking at the first level of the code, other team members can quickly understand the operations performed by the associated functions (`ChangeElementToAbsValue()`, `AreCoPrime()`, `IsParitySame()`, and `PrintPairs()`). They can reason about the code at a higher level without needing to delve into the implementation details of methods like `Math.abs()` or the internal workings of the GCD calculation. This higher-level understanding promotes easier collaboration and code comprehension among team members.

By adhering to clean function principles, such as having a single purpose, maintaining a consistent level of abstraction, and abstracting away implementation details, we create code that is more readable, maintainable, and easier to reason about. Clean functions lead to modular and reusable code, reducing complexity and improving overall code quality.
